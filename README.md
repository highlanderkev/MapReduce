There are two main directories:

1. mapreduce - this contains scala/sbt code for Question 1

2. remote_mapreduce - this contains scala/sbt code for Question 2


To Compile
---
1. 
- navigate to root folder /mapreduce
           
           $ sbt compile

2.
- start two shells/terminals and navigate to /remote_mapreduce/server & /remote_mapreduce/client

           $ sbt compile

To Run
---
1.
- folder /mapreduce

           $ sbt run

2.
- folder /remote_mapreduce/server
           $ sbt run

then

- folder /remote_mapreduce/client

           $ sbt run


Stopping
---
1.
- should automatically shutdown after map reduce jobs finish. 
        
           $ (Ctrl-x Ctrl-C) if needed

2. 
- also will auto shutdown (with a delay) after map reduce jobs finish.

           $ (Ctrl-x Ctrl-C) if needed
